    "- General purpose data processing engine designed for big data.\n",
    "- Spark is a platform for cluster computing.\n",
    "- Spark lets you spread data and computations over clusters with multiple nodes (each node as a separate computer). \n",
    "- Very large datasets are split into smaller datasets and  each node only works with a small amount of data.\n",
    "- Data processing and computation are performed in parallel over the nodes in the cluster. \n",
    "- However, with greater computing power comes greater complexity.\n",
    "- Can be used for Analytics, Data Integration, Machine learning, Stream Processing.\n",
    "- Master and Worker:\n",
    "    - Master: \n",
    "        - Connected to the rest of the computers in the cluster, which are called worker\n",

    "- Spark's core data structure is the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)\n",
    "- Instead of RDDs, it is easier to work with Spark DataFrame abstraction built on top of RDDs ( Operations using DataFrames are automatically optimized.)\n",
