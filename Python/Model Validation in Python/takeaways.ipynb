    "- Goal : Choose right model, right parameters, right accuracy metrics, high accuracy on new data\n",
    "- Overfitting : accuracy in test data is lower than accuracy in train data (High variance on train data)\n",
    "- Underfitting : accuracy in both train and test data is lower since the model is too simple to capture pattern (High bias, low variance)\n",
    "- Regression model : Target is a continuous value\n",
    "- Classification model : Target is a discrete value / category\n",
    "- parameter tuning : get the parameter of the model to see what parameters can be tuned\n"
